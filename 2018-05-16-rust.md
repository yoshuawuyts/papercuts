# rust

Borrowing from a match statement isn't possible.

## Details
A rather common pattern in systems is to have a caching layer in front of any
expensive operation. This is done because keeping old entries around in memory
is relatively cheap, and there's often a reasonable chance that if something was
recently requested, it might be requested again in the near future.

If building this in Rust, we might want to express it as such:

```rust
let node: &Node = match self.cache.get(key) {
  Some(node) => node,
  None => &self.db.get(key)?,
};
```

If there's an entry in the cache, we want to borrow the entry. But if there
isn't any, we want to check our database.

Because both arms of a `match` statement need to be equivalent, we need to
either convert the borrowed value from the cache into an `owned` value. Or
borrow the value from the database.

Creating an owned value is possible, but inconvenient. Either we need to `Clone`
the value, which is wasteful. Or we need to allow it to be accessed as `Cow`,
which I still haven't figured out how to use (and makes costs a bit harder to
reason about).

For me the most intuitive version would be to borrow the value returned from the
database. But in current versions of Rust that's not allowed, because the
lifetime of the value is dropped the moment the `match` statement is over.

## Proposed Solution
It'd be neat if the Rust compiler could figure out that it's rather alright to
allow borrowing from this match statement. Perhaps non-lexical lifetimes will
fix this, but I'm not sure.

In the case they don't, it might be worth figuring out a different solution.
That's about the best I've got for now, because I'm still relatively new to
Rust.
