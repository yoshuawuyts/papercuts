# Rust core

Using `for mut foo in &bar` didn't yield an `.iter_mut()`.

## Details

I was expecting the following to work:
```rust
Struct Feed {
  /// Update all peers.
  pub fn update_peers(&mut self) {
    for mut peer in &self.peers {
      peer.update();
    }
  }
}
```

But instead the `&` iterator cast couldn't infer that we were requesting mutable
references. Cargo's compiler wasn't really helpful, and suggested we use `ref
mut` instead (among other things; tried several variations).

Instead the correct solution was to use `.iter_mut()`

```rust
Struct Feed {
  /// Update all peers.
  pub fn update_peers(&mut self) {
    for mut peer in self.peers.iter_mut() {
      peer.update();
    }
  }
}
```

## Solutions
There are probably 2 things that can be done:

1. Better `rustc` help message if we have a `mut <var>` in an iterator.
   Suggesting to use `.iter_mut()` would've done wonders.
2. Allow Rust to infer that `for mut <var> in &iterator` means we probably want
   to call `.iter_mut()` and not `.iter()`.
